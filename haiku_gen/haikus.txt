{} and {} alone
madness of world locked away
{} and quiet reigns
111
Calm as a river
Tranquility in my {}
Blue summer {} reign
11
The light of a {}
Is transferred to another
Beautiful {}
12
An old {}
A {} jumps in
the sound of {}.
322
My {},
How much more of it remains?
The {} is brief.
42
I kill a {}
and realize my dear {}
has been watching me.
22
First autumn morning
the {} I stare into
shows my {}'s face.
22
Autumn {}
a {} digs silently
into the {}.
322
In the twilight {}
brilliant-hued {} -
A lovely {}
132
Light of the {}
Moves west, flowers' {}
Creep eastward.
23
kaleidoscope -
a {} enjoying {}
temporarily
12
another {}
two versions of the same {}
a {} nearby
212
aura of {}
Venus sews seeds of {}
old as {}
223
{} ritual...
a boy draws new {} to
the family tree
22
my clever {}
holds up five {} one of
them bent to mean half
